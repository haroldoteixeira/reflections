When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Whenever I need to share code with team, access code from differente machines and also when I want to backup code in an external provider.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Same reasons for separating staged area and commited area. I would only pull things that has some logical change meaning and are really usefull for other users.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are usefull to make a copy of a repository inside git hub in a simple operation. Clones are used to establish a initial sync copy of a repository on your local environment. Fianlly a branch allow splits in the commit story on your local environment.
